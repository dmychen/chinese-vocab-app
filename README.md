What is the game plan...  

## The Idea

Goal: A flashcard app specifically for chinese vocabulary.

### **Core Functionality**  
1. Add vocabulary (chinese, pinyin, and english definition) to a global db of flashcards
    - Insert, edit, delete flashcards.
2. Flashcards can be organized into flashcard sets. 
    - Insert flashcard into a set.
    - Delete from a set.
4. Display flashcards
    - display a list of vocab, or from a given set
3. Access a given flashcard set.
    - Sort which vocab is displayed randomly, or by spaced repetition.

### **Extra Feature Set**
1. Create a database of chinese vocabulary.
    - User can search for vocabulary.
    - Flashcards will automatically be populated based on database.
    - Users can edit existing flashcard or create from scratch.
2. Better flashcard algorithm:
    - Spaced repetition.
    - Priority based on manual user assignment (user can assign a priority to a flashcard)
    - Priority based on global standards (use character frequency rankings, how common the word is)
3. Displaying Flashcards by relation instead of set
    - based on relations from chinese vocab database:
        - Overlapping characters
        - Similar meaning
        - Same radicals
4. Import practice sentences and passages.
    - Import passages from external sources. 
    - Automatically determines the words used in the passage.
    - Flashcards automatically link to passages which contain that word.
    - Read passaged based on words in flashcard set
5. Generate practice sentences with ChatGPT integration
    - Based on a flashcard set or other filtering.
    - Or on global flashcard database
